# A-Feed-Forward-N.N-for-classifying-the-MNIST-Dataset
In this project we build a feed-forward Neural Network for identifying the handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. In particular, the scope of this project is to present all the major steps in constructing the model and then to introduce initializations and regularization techniques among others for improving its performance. Another major aspect of this work is the investigation of the model's hyper-parameters using cost and accuracy plots. Finally, even though there is room for improvement, we end up with a final model describing along the way why it is a probably effective choice.
